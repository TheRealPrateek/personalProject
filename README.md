### Let's mess around with some text styling!

**This sentence is bold.**

*This sentence is italic.*

***This sentence is bold and italic.***

1. This is an *ordered* list item.
2. Here's a second item.
3. And a third!
4. And here's a fourth, because why not?
   - Here's a *nested* item!
     - And another!
     
- [ ] Here's a checklist item.
- [ ] Here's another!
- [x] Here's one that's been checked off! :tada:
